In this research opportunity we will study and develop new algorithms for the U-Curve problem, an optimization problem described over a boolean lattice in which the objective function describes u-shaped curves. We intend to elaborate new strategies for a search of the best solution in the boolean lattice and apply them to the feature selection problem in Pattern Recognition.
